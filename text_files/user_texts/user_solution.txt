# 8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the
# split() method. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is
# already in the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting
# words in python sort() order as shown in the desired output. You can download the sample data at
