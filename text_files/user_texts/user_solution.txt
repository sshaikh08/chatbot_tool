#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out
# who has sent the greatest number of mail messages.
# The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
# The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they
# appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop
# to find the most prolific committer.
